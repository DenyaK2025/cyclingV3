            Cycling history began a long time ago, back in the 1800's, with strange old bikes made of wood and metal. Those early bikes, clled "Boneshakers" and "Penny--Farthings" looked very different from the bikes we ride today. Over time, cycling changed a lot and became popular all over the world. People now use bikes not just to get from place to place, bit also for fun, sport, and adventure. Some peoeple love racing on smooth roads, while others enjoy riding over dirt trails and mountains. Many ride their bikes to work or school, and some just enjoy relaxing weekend rides with friends and/or family. Cycling has become more than just a way to travel -- it's a hobby, a sport, and a way for millions of people around the world. <br>
