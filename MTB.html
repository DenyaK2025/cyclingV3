                Mountain biking is all about adventure, challenge, and adrenaline. Riders take on rough terails, rocky paths, steep hills, and forest routes that test their skills and courage. Unlike regular cycling, MTB is built for the wild -- with stronger frames, thick tires, and suspension systems that handle jumps, drops, and dirt. Whether you're flying down a downhill course or climbing a quiet forest trail, mountain biking connects you to nature in an exciting way!

                To get started with mountain biking, you dont need the fanciest gear, but the right setup makes a big difference. A good helmer, gloves, and a sturdy mountain bike are must-haves. You'll also want grippy shoes, water, and maybe even knee pads for tougher trails. Bikes come in different styles like cross-country, trail, and downhill, each made for a different kind of ride. Learning how to shift gears, handle corners, and stay balanced on rough ground is part of the fun -- and anyone can learn with a little practice!
